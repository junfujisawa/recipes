Ingredients:
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 1 cup whole milk
- 2/3 cup sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 6 large egg yolks
- Your choice of flavoring

Directions:
 1. In a small pot, simmer cream, milk, sugar and salt until sugar completely
    dissolves, about 5 minutes. Remove pot from heat. In a separate bowl, whisk
    yolks. Whisking constantly, slowly whisk about a third of the hot cream into
    the yolks, then whisk the yolk mixture back into the pot with the cream.
    Return pot to medium-low heat and gently cook until mixture is thick enough
    to coat the back of a spoon (about 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer).

 2. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Cool mixture to room temperature.
    Cover and chill at least 4 hours or overnight.

 3. Churn in an ice cream machine according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Serve
    directly from the machine for soft serve, or store in freezer until needed.
